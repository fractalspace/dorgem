<h2>External Program Storage</h2>

An external program can be useful for uploading with a special program like SSH, SCP or SFTP. It can also be useful when you use a script to generate a accompanying web page. The possibilities are unlimited!
<p>
<b>Name</b><br>
The unique name of this storage event. You can only change the name when you create a new item.
<p>
<b>Enable</b><br>
Is this event enabled?
<p>
<b>Interval X seconds/minutes/hours</b><br>
The time interval between between captures.
<p>
<b>Command</b><br>
The command to start. It <i>must</i> contain %s, that will be replaced with the temporary filename of the captured image. It can have the same <a href="Caption.htm">tags</a> as the text captions, so the filename can be date and time related. Remember that a '/' and ':' are invalid characters in a filename, therefore %G and %g are available. The time stamp is constructed when command is executed.
<p>
<b>Reset time when not stored</b><br>
Reset the timer when there has been no storage. This is most likely to happen when there has been no motion detected.
<p>
<b>Custom captions</b><br>
When you want to use custom captions for this store event, you need to check this option and create or adjust the custom captions with the Settings button.
