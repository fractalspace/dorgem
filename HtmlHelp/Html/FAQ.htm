<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<b>What does 'Dorgem' mean?</b>
<p>
Nothing (as far as I know). A program needs a name and I didn't want a name like WebCap, SuperCam, GreatCapture, etc. So I made a combination of letters which <i>could</i> be a word. I searched serveral Web Search Engines and none of them gave a result on 'Dorgem'. So I desided that would be the name.

<a name="winamp"><b>Now %W is no longer available, how do I show what is playing in Winamp?</b>
<p>
You can use the Winamp AMIP plug-in (<a href="http://amip.tools-for.net/" target="_blank">http://amip.tools-for.net/</a>) in combination with the File option of the <a href="CaptionText.htm">Text Caption</a>. The AMIP plug-in can create a text file with a lot of tags from the current playing song in Winamp.
<p>

<a name="custom"></a><b>Can you build a custom version for our portal site or company?</b>
<p>
No. As you must have noticed, you see I don't release new versions often. This is because I have limited time and I don't want to spend my time building a custom version, when I could have spend time to improve the normal version of Dorgem. Not even for some money. I've never released any of my software to make money out of it. I have a job that pays the bills and I want to decide when I work on my programs and not let it become an extra job, with all its side effects.
<p>
But you have access to the sources. As long as you respect the <a href="gpl-license.htm">GPL license</a>, you can make your own custom build version.
<p>

<b>Frank, is your webcam available on-line?</b>
<p>
Not much, but you can try it <a href="http://www.fesevur.com/webcam.php" target="_blank">here</a>.
