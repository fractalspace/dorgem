<h2>Personal Disclaimer</h2>

Thank you all for using Dorgem and for all the mails I've gotten. However, I feel I must clarify how I see this application. I've made it primarily for my own use and to be able to learn how to program the webcam. I also uploaded it on <a href="http://sourceforge.net" target="_blank">SourceForge</a> to share my work with others and to see what it means to start an open source project. I had never any intention of making it a "product" and I don't have unlimited time to fix bugs and make new features.
<p>
Most of the mails have been very kind with lots of suggestions. I like this very much! Unfortunately, some of the mails have very strongly <i>demanded</i> that I fix a bug or implement their most wanted function. This is <i>not</i> something I like. I give away Dorgem for free with no guarantees of a feature packed and bug-free software, eventhough I try. I implement the functions that <i>I</i> think the program needs.
<p>
This doesn't mean that I do not want mails with suggestions. Please, continue to send them to me. However, I can't promise to fix a bug or a new feature at once. I might do it, but it may take a time. Or, it simply won't be fixed at all. If you have a problem with this, buy commercial software instead or <i>much better</i>: <a href="HelpDevelop.htm">do it yourself</a> and <a href="Acknowledgments.htm">contribute</a>. You have access to the sources.
<p>
Sorry to all persons who have written e-mails to me without getting any answer.
<p>
Hope you understand!
