<h2>License</h2>
<p>
Dorgem is distributed under the <a href="GPL-License.htm">GNU General Public License</a>. Some parts of the code already had another (wider) license, so this off course is not changed.

<h2>Why open source?</h2>
<p>
<b>My main reason:</b><br>
The program is mainly based upon several classes and sources I found on the Internet. The only thing I did at start of this project was combine them to a useful program. Therefore I think the only proper way to do this is, make my part also OpenSource.
<p>
<b>Another important reason:</b><br>
I didn't want to make it shareware, since I didn't expect much registrations. And with shareware it becomes more work in stead of hobby. Registered users <i>expect</i> frequent updates, they loose their registration key, they <i>expect</i> quick and good support, etc.
<p>
So it should be freeware. But if it is freeware, why not make it open source? People can really get involved, add features and fix bugs. And luckily they do! It is quite motivating for me to get contributions.

<h2>Product status</h2>
<p>
Like every program (even onces you have to pay a lot of money for) the program can have bugs. Some of these bugs are <a href="ToDo.htm#bugs">already known</a>, others not. Please be aware that <a href="GPL-License.htm#warranty">no warranty</a> is given.
