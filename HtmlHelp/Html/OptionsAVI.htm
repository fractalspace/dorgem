<h2>AVI Options</h2>

<b>Use AVI archive</b><br>
Do you want all captured images to be stored in a uncompressed AVI file?
<p>
<b>Filename</b><br>
The filename for the AVI archive. It can have the same tags as the <a href="Caption.htm">text captions</a>, so the filename can be date and time related. Remember that a '/' and ':' are invalid characters in a filename, therefore %G and %g are available. The time stamp is constructed when the file is first created.
<p>
<b>Frames per second</b><br>
The number of frames per second in the AVI. This is not related to the frames per seconds of the preview window.
<p>
<b>New file at midnight</b><br>
Do you want a new file AVI file at midnight. If you do use this options, it is advised to use time related tags in the filename.
<p>
<strong>Know that only pictures taken by an enabled Store Event are stored in the archive. Pictures taken by the web server are <i>not</i> stored.</strong>
