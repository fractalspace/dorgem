<h2>Version History</h2>

<b><big>Version 2.1.0</big> <small>(24-May-2005)</small></b>
<p>

Major new features:

<ul>
  <li>Included Chris Bandy's contribution, the <a href="StoreHTTP.htm">HTTP Store Event</a> (feature request #672983).
  <li>Optional captions per storage event and seperate captions for the web server. This allows you to specify custom captions for every store event and seperate captions for the web server.
  <li>Moved away from the WinINet based FTP and use my own.
</ul>

Other new (or improved) features:

<ul>
  <li>Implemented RFE #1060982 "status-bar at the bottom". Now all storage events show the status of the last store in the status bar.
  <li>Added a shortcut to the help file to the start menu.
  <li>Made a user interface for the Transparent color of the overlay bitmap caption.
  <li>Implemented RFE #837200 "Passive/Active FTP". Thanks to Steve Thom for testing it.
  <li>Added a status bar to the main dialog. This shows useful information on what the program is busy with. Thanks to John Boers a.k.a. DigiDodo for this suggestion.
  <li>Implemented RFE #791330 "Button to switch capture on or off". This only affects the automatic captures and not the 'Capture now' button.
  <li>Implemented RFE #775380 "FTP Storage for Non-Standard Ports". This was already possible in the registry, now added a textbox to the UI.
  <li>Included contribution of Aaron Kondziela, storing the file on the FTP server on a temporary name and rename it after uploading.
  <li>Implemented RFE #663750 "Retain FTP connection".
  <li>Implemented RFE #700475 "Logfile". This option is only configurable in registry <code>LogFile</code> and <code>LogLevel</code> (0=Only Errors, 3=Normal)
  <li>By default the OK button is disabled in the 'Add Caption' and 'Add Store Event' dialog.
  <li>Implemented the optional creation of directories for the <a href="StoreFile.htm">File Store Event</a>. Especially useful if the filespec contains directory-names with tags (e.g. "C:\Camera\%G\%g.jpg").
  <li>Start minimized, when /m is specified on the <a href="CommandLine.htm">command line</a>, as suggested in #659454. Thanks to Brooks Younce for his contribution.
  <li>Dorgem has a new icon. Thanks to Andrew Keyser for his contribution.
  <li>The <a href="StoreProgram.htm">External Program Store Event</a> now also can use the <a href="Caption.htm">time related tags</a> in the command.
  <li>Improvements to the 'Check Version' button in the About dialog. Now beta versions can be detected as 'new version' and can detect the release of the final version.
</ul>

Bugs fixed:

<ul>
  <li>Fixed bug #1191508 "cvs 2.1.0b6 bug", temporary files not always cleaned up.
  <li>Fixed bug #1104910 "error dialogues". Added an checkbox "Show Message Boxes" to the <a href="OptionsGeneral.htm">Options</a>.
  <li>When Dorgem or the preview window is moved to a secondary monitor, the position was not properly restored.
  <li>Fixed bug #954886 "Preview Window Clipped Incorrectly in 640"
  <li>Fixed bug #905024 "Captions problems?".
  <li>Fixed bug #855699 "Bitmap captions turn to text captions".
  <li>The preview window was always updated even when is was not shown. This causes bandwidth problems of the USB bus with some USB webcams when using multiple cameras. Thanks to Greg Ordy for spotting this problem.
  <li>Fixed bug #777333 "Log file not saved to fixed directory". When no full path is given, logs are stored in the directory where Dorgem.exe is located.
  <li>When no capture device was available on the system, the buttons were not properly disabled.
  <li>When a storage event was removed, the Up and Down buttons were not always properly updated.
  <li>Fixed bug #723787 "Problems with 2 webcams". The temporary file was not always unique.
</ul>

<p>

<b><big>Version 2.0.0</big> <small>(02-Jan-2003)</small></b>
<p>
Major new features:

<ul>
  <li><a href="OptionsWebServer.htm">Web Server</a> for still images
  <li>Added <a href="StoreProgram.htm">External Program Store Event</a>. Can be useful for SSH, SCP or SFTP upload (feature request #629434), or when you use a script to generate an accompanying web page.
</ul>

Other new (or improved) features:

<ul>
  <li>The filenames for <a href="StoreFile.htm">File</a> and <a href="StoreFTP.htm">FTP</a> storage can be time related.
  <li>Added %G <a href="Caption.htm">caption format</a>. It displays the date in filename safe yyyymmdd format
  <li>Added %g <a href="Caption.htm">caption format</a>. It displays the time in filename safe hhmmss format
  <li>Added %z <a href="Caption.htm">caption format</a>. It displays the difference between the current time and UTC.
  <li>The <a href="CaptionText.htm">Text Caption</a> has two types of shadow
  <li>The <a href="CaptionText.htm">Text Caption</a> can be read the first line of a text file. So you can generate a text file from another application with dynamic information (like weather info) and put it on the image.
  <li>The length of the <a href="CaptionText.htm">Text Caption</a> can be limited (suggested in bug report #655134)
  <li>It is also possible to specify the interval in minutes and hours for all storage events
  <li>Both caption types have a new (sub)dialog to handle the <a href="CaptionPos.htm">position</a>. Therefore now it is possible to configure the absolute position without editing in the registry.
  <li>Deleted the text caption tag '%W'. See the <a href="FAQ.htm#winamp">FAQ</a> how this can be handled now (and much more flexible).
</ul>

Bugs fixed:

  <li>The ordering of the events could get corrupted.
  <li>In the file storage event, when you press '...', the dialog would return to its original state (Bug #642846)

<p>

  <li>New text caption tag '%W'. It shows the current song playing in Winamp 2.x
  <li>Allow only one instance to run (per camera)
  <li>Abilty to reconnect the camera/device when no motion has been detected for X minutes. Thanks to Mike Ryan for providing this solution as a workaround to solve problems with bogus camera drivers.
  <li>Also added the 'Reset time when not stored' to the file storage. This to prevent too intensive checking if there was no storage because of the motion detection.
  <li>Better help file and help integration
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>When you added a new caption or a FTP storage, you would get the useless error message 'String too short' (Bug #629439).

</ul>

Bugs fixed:

<ul>
  <li>When the type of an event was missing or corrupted in the registry, Dorgem would come in an infinite loop. Thanks to Paul Mutton for spotting this problem.
