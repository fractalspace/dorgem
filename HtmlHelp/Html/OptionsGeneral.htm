<h2>General Options</h2>

<b>Minimize to system tray</b><br>
Do you want the program to minimize to the system tray (next to the clock) or on the taskbar?
<p>
<b>Use motion detection</b><br>
Do you want to use <a href="MotionDetection.htm">motion detection</a>.
<p>
<b>Reconnect if no motion is detected for X minutes</b><br>
This will reconnect the camera/device when no motion has been detected for X minutes.
<p>
It is to provide a solution (as a workaround) to solve problems with bogus camera drivers. Some cameras (we know of some Logitech and Labtec webcams) have problems with automaticly adjusting brightness and contrast. They make the images black or white after a while.
<p>
<b>Show message boxes</b><br>
Show error message boxes when something goes wrong when processing a captured image.
