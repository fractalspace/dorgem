<h2>Web Server Options</h2>

<b>Server type</b><br>
What type of web server do you want: no server or still images?
<p>
<b>Port</b><br>
The port the web server must listen at. The standard Web server port is 80, but remember that often a web server already is running on Windows 2000 and Window XP, so it is advised to use another port number like 8080.
<p>
<b>Refresh Rate</b><br>
The web server can request that the client refresh the image after X seconds. Not all clients will honor this request. To disable it set it to 0.
<p>
<b>Log File</b><br>
The filename of the access log. It can have the same tags as the <a href="Caption.htm">text captions</a>, so the filename can be date and time related. Remember that a '/' and ':' are invalid characters in a filename, therefore %G and %g are available.
<p>
<b>Custom captions</b><br>
When you want to use custom captions for the web server, you need to check this option and create or adjust the custom captions with the Settings button.
<p>
<b>NOTICE</b><br>
Please know that the pictures send by the web server are not stored in the <a href="OptionsAVI.htm">AVI</a> and <a href="MotionDetection.htm">motion detection</a> is bypassed by the web server.
