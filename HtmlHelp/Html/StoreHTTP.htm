<h2>HTTP Storage</h2>

HTTP storage is also known as WebDAV or Web Folders
<p>

<b>Name</b><br>
The unique name of this storage event. You can only change the name when you create a new item.
<p>
<b>Enable</b><br>
Is this event enabled?
<p>
<b>Interval X seconds/minutes/hours</b><br>
The time interval between between captures.
<p>
<b>Secure</b><br>
Use the secure HTTP protocol (HTTPS), in stead of the standard HTTP protocol.
<p>
<b>Host</b><br>
This is the internet address of your HTTP server.
<p>
<b>Username</b><br>
The username to use when logging on to the HTTP server.
<p>
<b>Password</b><br>
The password to use when logging on to the HTTP server. The password is stored in the registry, with a relatively simple encryption mechanism. <i>There is a potential security risk.</i> If someone has access to your registry and they could break the encryption, this will give them access to your account.
<p>
<b>File</b><br>
This is the filename that you wish to store on the server. You may need to include a directory in the filename. It can have the same <a href="Caption.htm">tags</a> as the text captions, so the filename can be date and time related. Remember that a '/' and ':' are invalid characters in a filename, therefore %G and %g are available. The time stamp is constructed when the file is uploaded to the server.
<p>
<b>Use RAS</b><br>
Do you want to check for an active RAS connection (Remote Access Service, also known as Dial-up connections) before the upload is attempted.
<p>
<b>Connection</b><br>
Specify the RAS connection to look for.
<p>
<b>Reset time when not stored</b><br>
Reset the timer when there has been no storage. This is most likely to happen when there has been no motion detected or there has been no RAS connection.
<p>
<b>Custom captions</b><br>
When you want to use custom captions for this store event, you need to check this option and create or adjust the custom captions with the Settings button.
