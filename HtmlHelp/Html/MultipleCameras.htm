<h2>Multiple Cameras</h2>

From version 1.2.0 Dorgem has support for multiple cameras. Using the command line, you can now specify different cameras.
<p>
You can create a new configuration, by starting Dorgem with the command-line parameters:
<p>
<blockquote>/c:config</blockquote>
<p>
The configuration name 'config' is any name you wish as long as it only contains characters 'a' to 'z', 'A' to 'Z' or '0' to '9'.
<p>
If you have two different cameras, you could make two shortcuts to start Dorgem with the following command-lines:

<blockquote>
dorgem.exe<br>
dorgem.exe /c:cam2
</blockquote>

<b>Notes:</b>

<ul>
  <li>The first one has no parameters, so the default configuration is being used.
  <li>I got reports from someone with two identical Labtec cameras, that is very difficult to set him up for multi camera support.
</ul>
